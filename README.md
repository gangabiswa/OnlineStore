# Online Store Application

## Description of the Project

This Java console application serves as an online store simulation. Its main purpose is to allow users to browse available products, add them to a shopping cart, view their cart contents, and proceed to checkout. The intended users are customers who wish to shop online conveniently from their command line interface.
